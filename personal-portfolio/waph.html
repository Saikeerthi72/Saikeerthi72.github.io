<h2>Course Overview</h2>

<h3>Lab 0 Overview</h3>

<p>In the initial part of the lab, I became acquainted with Wireshark, a packet analysis tool, and delved into understanding packet information within the HTTP protocol. Through practical exercises involving telnet and Wireshark, I gained insight into protocol behavior and packet transmission.</p>
<p>In the second part of the lab, I engaged in tasks related to web development. I authored a .c file and converted it into a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) file, enabling its execution within a web browser via the Apache2 service. Additionally, I crafted an HTML file called index.cgi and executed it. Furthermore, I explored PHP scripts such as helloworld.php and echo.php, scrutinizing their request and response cycles using tools like Wireshark and curl.</p>

<h3>Lab 1 Overview</h3>

<p>This task consisted of two subtasks. In the first part, I worked on basic HTML implementation, integrating tags, images, and forms into a document. Subsequently, I ventured into JavaScript integration within HTML, showcasing functionalities like displaying the current date/time, logging keyboard inputs, toggling email visibility, and incorporating an analog clock via external JavaScript.</p>
<p>Task 2 encompassed four distinct parts. The first segment focused on AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), where I wrote code to facilitate user input, AJAX GET requests to echo.php, and handling HTTP responses. The subsequent part delved into CSS implementation, applying a chosen stylesheet to specific HTML elements. Moving forward, I explored jQuery integration, executing AJAX requests to echo.php via both GET and POST methods. Lastly, I utilized jQuery to fetch and display random jokes from an API, inspecting request and response interactions within the browser's network tab.</p>


<h3>Hackathon 1  Overview</h3>

<p>This component of the hackathon centered on understanding various attacks employed against websites, particularly focusing on cross-scripting attacks. I familiarized myself with the intricacies of input validation and encoding techniques as crucial measures to mitigate such attacks.</p>
<p>The second task of the hackathon revolved around input validation and encoding methodologies. I delved into comprehending the importance of data validation pre and post-response, emphasizing the significance of robust validation mechanisms in safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities.</p>

<h3>Individual Project 1 Overview</h3>
<p>I have created a portfolio website on GitHub pages showing my resume, background, experiences, and skills. I have used an open-source CSS template, Bootstrap for an appealing interface. I have dedicated a page introducing about the "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course and associated projects. Also incorporated basic JavaScript functionality, jQuery, and Angular JS functionality. I have integrated two public Web APIs to demonstrate a joke API and showcase my skills in a line chart. I have also implemented JavaScript cookies to track the returning visitors and include a page tracker.</p>
